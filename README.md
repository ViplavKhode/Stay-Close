# Stay Close

A real-time location tracking application built with Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and Leaflet. Stay Close allows users to share their geolocation in real-time, trace movement paths, and view distances from other connected users.

## Features

- **Real-Time Location Sharing**: Automatically shares your live location with the server using web sockets.
- **Interactive Map**: Visualizes connected users on an OpenStreetMap interface via Leaflet.js.
- **Path Tracing**: Draws a specific colored path trail behind each user to visualize their movement history.
- **Distance Calculator**: Calculates and displays the real-time distance between you and every other user.
- **User Identity**: Onboarding modal to set a display name upon joining.
- **Active User Panel**: A draggable translucent panel listing all connected users and their distances.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Markers and paths update instantly as users move.
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Removes markers and paths when a user disconnects.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.io
- **Frontend**: EJS (Templating), CSS (Glassmorphism UI), Vanilla JavaScript
